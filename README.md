# distributed_consensus_containment
MATLAB implementation of the paper "Distributed Optimization of Average Consensus Containment with Multiple Stationary Leaders" [arXiv 2022].

## **Usage** 

This implementation provides a setup as demonstrated in the paper having 24 agents (10 leaders and 14 followers), connected over a directed network topology. The topology has been chosen randomly such that it satisfies the assumptions listed in the paper.

## **Requirements**

CVX package is required to be pre-installed with the MATLAB.
