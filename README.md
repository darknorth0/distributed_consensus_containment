# Distributed Optimization of Average Consensus Containment with Multiple Stationary Leaders
This repository is the official implementation of the paper [Distributed Optimization of Average Consensus Containment with Multiple Stationary Leaders.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16451)

## Usage : 

This implementation provides a setup as demonstrated in the paper having 24 agents (10 leaders and 14 followers), connected over a directed network topology. The topology has been chosen randomly such that it satisfies the assumptions listed in the paper.

## Requirements :

CVX package is required to be pre-installed with the MATLAB.
